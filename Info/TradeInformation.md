## 8. Face Value – 10

### Definition:

**Face Value**, also known as **par value** or **nominal value**, is the **original value** of a stock or bond when it is issued by the company. It is fixed and does not change with the market price fluctuations.

### Explanation:

- For the stock in your example, the face value is ₹10. This means that when the company first issued its shares, they were valued at ₹10 each.

- The face value of this stock is ₹10, which is its nominal value. This is different from its market value, which changes based on trading.

### Why is Face Value Important?

- **Dividend Calculation**: Companies often declare dividends based on the face value. For example, if a company declares a 100% dividend on a stock with a face value of ₹10, that means ₹10 dividend per share.

- **Stock Splits**: If a company does a stock split, it may reduce the face value. For example, if the face value is ₹10, a 2-for-1 split will change it to ₹5.

- **Accounting and Reporting**: Face value is used in accounting, specifically for calculating the company's capital structure.

### Example:

Suppose a stock has a face value of `₹10` but its market price is `₹500`. This means the stock is currently trading at `₹500` in the market, but its face value, as per the company’s books, is still `₹10`.

## Summary:

- Traded Volume and Traded Value show the trading activity.
- Total Market Cap and Free Float Market Cap reflect the company’s size and the shares available for public trading.
- Impact Cost helps gauge liquidity, while Deliverable Percentage indicates how much trading was for actual delivery.
- Margin Rate shows the amount required to trade on margin, and Face Value refers to the stock’s original value.

These metrics provide valuable insights into the stock's liquidity, market value, and trading dynamics, helping traders make informed decisions.
