# Liquidity practical example

## Scenario 1: High Liquidity Stock

Imagine you want to buy shares of **Reliance Industries**, a large-cap stock on the `NSE`. It’s a popular stock that trades millions of shares daily. Here’s what happens:

### 1. Bid-Ask Spread:

- The **bid price** (highest price a buyer is willing to pay) is ₹2,500.
- The **ask price** (lowest price a seller is willing to accept) is ₹2,501.
- The difference between the bid and ask prices is just ₹1, which is a **tight spread**.

### 2. High Volume:

- Let’s say the stock has already traded 5 million shares today, which shows that many people are buying and selling this stock.

## What Does This Mean for You?

- If you want to buy 100 shares at ₹2,501, there’s a very high chance that someone will sell them to you instantly at that price because there are **_many sellers in the market_**.
- You can also sell your shares easily, and you will likely get a price very close to ₹2,500. This is because there are **_many buyers and sellers_**, so the price doesn’t need to move a lot for your order to be filled.

### In this case, Reliance is a highly liquid stock because:

- There are many participants (high volume), and
- The difference between what buyers are willing to pay and what sellers are asking for is small (tight bid-ask spread).

## Scenario 2: Low Liquidity Stock

Now, imagine you want to buy shares of a **small-cap company**, which trades very little during the day. Here's how it works:

### 1. Bid-Ask Spread:

- The **bid price** is ₹150 (highest a buyer will pay).
- The **ask price** is ₹155 (lowest a seller will accept).
- The difference is ₹5, which is a **wide spread**.

### 2. Low Volume:

- Only 2,000 shares have been traded today. That means not many people are buying or selling this stock.

## What Does This Mean for You?

- If you want to buy 100 shares, you’ll probably have to pay the **full ask price** of ₹155, because there aren’t many sellers and the spread is wide.
- If you try to sell your shares right after buying, you might only get the **bid price** of ₹150, meaning you’ll lose ₹5 per share immediately.

In this case, the stock is **illiquid** because:

- There aren’t many people trading it (low volume),
- The spread between what buyers and sellers want is large (wide bid-ask spread).

## Summary:

- **High liquidity** means you can easily buy or sell without significantly affecting the price, and you'll likely pay a price close to the current market price (tight spread, high volume).
- **Low liquidity** means it’s harder to buy or sell quickly, and you might have to accept a significantly worse price (wide spread, low volume).
