# Stock Trading Strategy

## Intraday Stock Trading Strategy

### 1. Liquidity and Volume:

- Choose stocks with high liquidity and trading volume. These stocks tend to have tight spreads and allow for easier entry/exit. Popular choices include large-cap stocks such as **_Reliance_**, **_HDFC Bank_**, **_Infosys_**, and **_TCS_**.

### 2. Volatility:

- Focus on stocks with enough volatility to generate significant price movements during the day. Stocks with news (earnings reports, announcements) or technical setups (breakouts, trends) are ideal. [Click for More](/01-Basics/Stock%20Trading%20Strategy/02-Volatility/README.md)

### 3. Trend Identification:

- Look for stocks in a strong uptrend or downtrend. Using **`moving averages`** (e.g., `9 EMA`, `20 EMA`) or `trendlines` can help in identifying the stockâ€™s direction. [Click for More](/01-Basics/Stock%20Trading%20Strategy/03-TrendIdentification/README.md)

### 4. Breakouts and Range Trading:

- Watch for stocks breaking out of **`consolidation patterns`** (like a `triangle` or `range`). Stocks that break key resistance or support levels often see rapid movements. [Click for More](/01-Basics/Stock%20Trading%20Strategy/04-Breakouts%20and%20Range%20Trading/README.md)

### 5. Momentum Trading:

- Scan for stocks with strong momentum, where prices are moving sharply in one direction. Use momentum indicators like `RSI`, `MACD`, or `Volume Oscillator` to identify **overbought**/ **oversold** conditions.

### 6. Pre-Market Data:

- Check the pre-market or opening session data for stocks that are seeing significant price or volume changes. This can indicate potential for big movements during the day.

### 7. Sector Strength:

- Choose stocks from sectors showing strength or weakness for the day. For example, if the IT sector is strong, trading stocks like TCS, Infosys, or Wipro might be favorable.

### 8. Risk Management:

- Keep strict stop losses to limit losses. In volatile markets, managing risk is key to prevent large drawdowns.

## Key Differences in Strategy

- **Stocks**: Requires a focus on price movements and trends. You can rely on technical analysis and market news to guide trades.
- **Options**: In addition to price movement, options require a deep understanding of volatility, time decay (theta), and other option-specific Greeks like delta and vega.
