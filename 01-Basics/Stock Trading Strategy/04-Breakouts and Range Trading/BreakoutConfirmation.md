# Breakout Confirmation

When traders say that a **breakout should be confirmed with a close above/below the level**, they mean that instead of entering a trade the moment the price touches or breaks through a support or resistance level, you should wait for the price to "**close**" (finish the trading period) beyond that level.

## Explanation:

- "**Close**" refers to the price at the end of a specific [timeframe](/01-Basics/Stock%20Trading%20Strategy/04-Breakouts%20and%20Range%20Trading/TimeFrameForIntradayTrader.md) (such as a minute, hour, or day). For example, **on a daily chart**, the close is the price at **the end of the trading day**.
- A **breakout** is considered more reliable when the price closes **above a resistance level** or **below a support level**, because this shows that the market is sustaining the breakout rather than just briefly testing that level.

## Practical Example:

- Imagine a stock has a resistance level at `₹200`.
- During the trading day, the price spikes above `₹200` for a short time but then drops back down below `₹200` before the market closes. This is **not a confirmed breakout** because the price did not stay above `₹200` by the end of the trading period.
- However, if the price moves above `₹200` and closes at `₹205` at the end of the trading day, it confirms the breakout. The price has sustained its move beyond the resistance, signaling that the breakout might lead to further upward movement.

## Why Wait for Confirmation?

- **Avoid False Breakouts**: Sometimes prices momentarily move beyond support or resistance but then reverse quickly. Waiting for a closing price above resistance or below support helps you avoid false breakouts that fail to hold.
- **Stronger Signals**: When the price closes beyond a key level, it shows that the market is accepting the new price level, increasing the chances that the breakout will continue.

In summary, waiting for the breakout to be **confirmed** with a close above or below the level reduces the risk of getting caught in **fake breakouts** and provides stronger signals for entering trades.
